crash on findy for food info?{{{1
was not impl exception so..who knows.  we dont have a real impl mayb just remove that test one?}}}
default description for non-info{{{1
entries description is probbably about the foodinfo used. none info needs to say sth like "manual". maybe hide desc if null? it's takin vert space even when empty i think
 - Need to check both info and noninfo look okok
}}}
what happens when u remove last ti {{{
in maintabs.selectedplanitem, it does value.thing...
}}}
vrv date and time on entries{{{1 
yeah
ive slapped on a timepicker bound to same thing...see if that plays nice.
ok stacking it...would love flowlayout...
}}}
VRV Title Formatting{{{1
it's got issues, naming, caps etc
 - defaulter are stull fucked}}}
100g Grams on info screen{{{
sth went wrong there....
it is totally fucked now. object.tostring
}}}
npe propchance "valid" on vrVM{{{
dunno what's triggering it...perhaps the converter?
only got it on second opening of "eat"

that makes sense.  I've moved to manual observation of inotifiyproperychanged cause i dont trust setbinding to remove the old binding. second time would indeed be the crash.
}}}
Validition highghting is turned off {{{1
it got turned off fixing canvas bug, can put on row of the vrv
 - it's not redding
 - the frame has fucky padding

 - hmm ok well maybe this time? I'm manual bindings now ... but maybe frame.outlinecolor isnt right.  where is that thicknessss? maybe is not what i think it is.
