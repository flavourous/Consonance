crash on findy for food info?{{{1
was not impl exception so..who knows.  we dont have a real impl mayb just remove that test one?
still button there on foorm.....hgmmmm
ther's a finderadapter that inserts, it wasnt checking "canfind" property lol. should call it the "pleasedont" property :D
}}}
Validition highghting is turned off {{{1
it got turned off fixing canvas bug, can put on row of the vrv
 - it's not redding
 - the frame has fucky padding

 - hmm ok well maybe this time? I'm manual bindings now ... but maybe frame.outlinecolor isnt right.  where is that thicknessss? maybe is not what i think it is.
 - lookslike it;s not defaulting to off. otherwise looks k. the ignore i mean.
}}}
default description for non-info{{{1
entries description is probbably about the foodinfo used. none info needs to say sth like "manual". maybe hide desc if null? it's takin vert space even when empty i think
 - Need to check both info and noninfo look okok
 - its too tall still..maybe not variable row height?
 - descriptino needs smaller italicetc
 > ok ive added some colors to check blocks. font changed.
}}}
vrv date and time on entries{{{1 
yeah
ive slapped on a timepicker bound to same thing...see if that plays nice.
ok stacking it...would love flowlayout...
looks stupid, again flow would be nice. might just vstack it. 
 - ok well idk if works, the entrylinevm is just showing 00:04 all the times...
ok thats the month in MM....still weird. I think probabbly the request isnt doing anything.
ive set bp on after vrv to se whats happening on the value...it should work..
}}}
what happens when u remove last ti {{{
in maintabs.selectedplanitem, it does value.thing...
 - it;s well fucked. cant click any plan,well i added a new and selecging it did nothing. theres sth broken in there?
 - ive added logging around selecting instnaces see if it completes.
