what happens when u remove last ti {{{
in maintabs.selectedplanitem, it does value.thing...
 - it;s well fucked. cant click any plan,well i added a new and selecging it did nothing. theres sth broken in there?
 - ive added logging around selecting instnaces see if it completes.
 - ok and i have crash on fresh app, adding instance,jnpe on inTabName. hmm. check ui marshaling?
 - alight the MTVM class doesnt contain SelectedPlanItem.  It's probabbly the root of all problems here. i've pushed it accrosss...

vrv date and time on entries{{{1 
yeah
ive slapped on a timepicker bound to same thing...see if that plays nice.
ok stacking it...would love flowlayout...
looks stupid, again flow would be nice. might just vstack it. 
 - ok well idk if works, the entrylinevm is just showing 00:04 all the times...
ok thats the month in MM....still weird. I think probabbly the request isnt doing anything.
ive set bp on after vrv to se whats happening on the value...it should work..
 - displays ok, but, vrv not binding to the time of "when"
 - cause really ned datepicker.format. see if this one works!!
 - nope. need timepicker, but it uses TimeSpan. need converter.
 - ok wrong converter assgiened?

Validition highghting is turned off {{{1
it got turned off fixing canvas bug, can put on row of the vrv
 - it's not redding
 - the frame has fucky padding

 - hmm ok well maybe this time? I'm manual bindings now ... but maybe frame.outlinecolor isnt right.  where is that thicknessss? maybe is not what i think it is.
 - lookslike it;s not defaulting to off. otherwise looks k. the ignore i mean.
 - it's off allrght, but not being turned on after clicky!
 - but it worked on tracker add...hmm..just on entries its not redding...
- gonna hae to debug this.
 - there was a mising ui invoke.
 - still nope. hmm.
 - crashy times too
}}}
default description for non-info{{{1
entries description is probbably about the foodinfo used. none info needs to say sth like "manual". maybe hide desc if null? it's takin vert space even when empty i think
 - Need to check both info and noninfo look okok
 - its too tall still..maybe not variable row height?
 - descriptino needs smaller italicetc
 > ok ive added some colors to check blocks. font changed.
 - hmm, changing double stack to a grid.
 - yep good. needs fill or center vertical aligns.
