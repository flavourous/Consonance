default description for non-info{{{1
entries description is probbably about the foodinfo used. none info needs to say sth like "manual". maybe hide desc if null? it's takin vert space even when empty i think
 - Need to check both info and noninfo look okok
 - its too tall still..maybe not variable row height?
 - descriptino needs smaller italicetc
 > ok ive added some colors to check blocks. font changed.
 - hmm, changing double stack to a grid.

what happens when u remove last ti {{{
in maintabs.selectedplanitem, it does value.thing...
 - it;s well fucked. cant click any plan,well i added a new and selecging it did nothing. theres sth broken in there?
 - ive added logging around selecting instnaces see if it completes.
 - ok and i have crash on fresh app, adding instance,jnpe on inTabName. hmm. check ui marshaling?
 - alight the MTVM class doesnt contain SelectedPlanItem.  It's probabbly the root of all problems here. i've pushed it accrosss...

vrv date and time on entries{{{1 
yeah
ive slapped on a timepicker bound to same thing...see if that plays nice.
ok stacking it...would love flowlayout...
looks stupid, again flow would be nice. might just vstack it. 
 - ok well idk if works, the entrylinevm is just showing 00:04 all the times...
ok thats the month in MM....still weird. I think probabbly the request isnt doing anything.
ive set bp on after vrv to se whats happening on the value...it should work..
 - displays ok, but, vrv not binding to the time of "when"
 - cause really ned datepicker.format. see if this one works!!
