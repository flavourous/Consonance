Problems with PCL {{{
it wouldnt load if it was a superscope ns/asm of the including droid ns/asm.  Wouldnt load the App class with that ns "conflict".  With the "asm" conflict, I got random binding errors even though the asm directives were ok NPE and stuff.  Guessits xamarin framework assuming around non-exotic ns/asm setups.}}}
flectors are fucked?{{{
 - well, adding an entry with an info doesnt work, crashes during flector. I did change te impl of those.  I cant breakpoint it either...sth strange maybe VS+Xamarin? Dunno.  I'm tracing instead.
 - so GetDeclaredProperty we replaced for the PCL with, will not get properties of superclasses, only those declared on the class inspecting. abstracted into IPlatform and acutlay the plats are implimenting with GetProperty.
