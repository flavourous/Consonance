Problems with PCL {{{
it wouldnt load if it was a superscope ns/asm of the including droid ns/asm.  Wouldnt load the App class with that ns "conflict".  With the "asm" conflict, I got random binding errors even though the asm directives were ok NPE and stuff.  Guessits xamarin framework assuming around non-exotic ns/asm setups.}}}
flectors are fucked?{{{
 - well, adding an entry with an info doesnt work, crashes during flector. I did change te impl of those.  I cant breakpoint it either...sth strange maybe VS+Xamarin? Dunno.  I'm tracing instead.
 - so GetDeclaredProperty we replaced for the PCL with, will not get properties of superclasses, only those declared on the class inspecting. abstracted into IPlatform and acutlay the plats are implimenting with GetProperty.

npe propchance "valid" on vrVM{{{
dunno what's triggering it...perhaps the converter?
only got it on second opening of "eat"

that makes sense.  I've moved to manual observation of inotifiyproperychanged cause i dont trust setbinding to remove the old binding. second time would indeed be the crash.
 - nope still fucks it.  it's on "resetrequests" so perhaps sth bound still to "valid" that's out of scope?
 - looks fixed.  I've done unbinding on ClearItmems on the vrv. proabbly reusing the valuerequestobjects.
