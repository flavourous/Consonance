:oblems with PCL {{{
it wouldnt load if it was a superscope ns/asm of the including droid ns/asm.  Wouldnt load the App class with that ns "conflict".  With the "asm" conflict, I got random binding errors even though the asm directives were ok NPE and stuff.  Guessits xamarin framework assuming around non-exotic ns/asm setups.}}}
flectors are fucked?{{{
 - well, adding an entry with an info doesnt work, crashes during flector. I did change te impl of those.  I cant breakpoint it either...sth strange maybe VS+Xamarin? Dunno.  I'm tracing instead.
 - so GetDeclaredProperty we replaced for the PCL with, will not get properties of superclasses, only those declared on the class inspecting. abstracted into IPlatform and acutlay the plats are implimenting with GetProperty.

manage on in/out should be infos?{{{
manage is silly....bettwer describing word?
use off of dialect like "foods" "burns"?
}}}
100g Grams on info screen{{{
sth went wrong there....
it is totally fucked now. object.tostring
}}}
VRV Title Formatting{{{1
it's got issues, naming, caps etc
 - defaulter are stull fucked}}}
npe propchance "valid" on vrVM{{{
dunno what's triggering it...perhaps the converter?
only got it on second opening of "eat"

that makes sense.  I've moved to manual observation of inotifiyproperychanged cause i dont trust setbinding to remove the old binding. second time would indeed be the crash.
 - nope still fucks it.  it's on "resetrequests" so perhaps sth bound still to "valid" that's out of scope?
 - looks fixed.  I've done unbinding on ClearItmems on the vrv. proabbly reusing the valuerequestobjects.
}}}
crash on findy for food info?{{{1
was not impl exception so..who knows.  we dont have a real impl mayb just remove that test one?
still button there on foorm.....hgmmmm
ther's a finderadapter that inserts, it wasnt checking "canfind" property lol. should call it the "pleasedont" property :D
 - searchy is gone.
}}}
what happens when u remove last ti {{{
in maintabs.selectedplanitem, it does value.thing...
 - it;s well fucked. cant click any plan,well i added a new and selecging it did nothing. theres sth broken in there?
 - ive added logging around selecting instnaces see if it completes.
 - ok and i have crash on fresh app, adding instance,jnpe on inTabName. hmm. check ui marshaling?
 - alight the MTVM class doesnt contain SelectedPlanItem.  It's probabbly the root of all problems here. i've pushed it accrosss...
 - i think it was because we didnt wait for popasyncs to complete before altering the uis.  proper awaits now.
}}}
vrv date and time on entries{{{1 
yeah
ive slapped on a timepicker bound to same thing...see if that plays nice.
ok stacking it...would love flowlayout...
looks stupid, again flow would be nice. might just vstack it. 
 - ok well idk if works, the entrylinevm is just showing 00:04 all the times...
ok thats the month in MM....still weird. I think probabbly the request isnt doing anything.
ive set bp on after vrv to se whats happening on the value...it should work..
 - displays ok, but, vrv not binding to the time of "when"
 - cause really ned datepicker.format. see if this one works!!
 - nope. need timepicker, but it uses TimeSpan. need converter.
 - ok wrong converter assgiened?
 - and more fucked stuff. only had convert on one!
 - ok it works, but theres another bug im raising.  sqlite.net is decrementing values by 1h when storing! unless datetimeasticks is set to false :/.
}}}
Validition highghting is turned off {{{1
it got turned off fixing canvas bug, can put on row of the vrv
 - it's not redding
 - the frame has fucky padding

 - hmm ok well maybe this time? I'm manual bindings now ... but maybe frame.outlinecolor isnt right.  where is that thicknessss? maybe is not what i think it is.
 - lookslike it;s not defaulting to off. otherwise looks k. the ignore i mean.
 - it's off allrght, but not being turned on after clicky!
 - but it worked on tracker add...hmm..just on entries its not redding...
- gonna hae to debug this.
 - there was a mising ui invoke.
 - still nope. hmm.
 - crashy times too
 - is ok now. it seems
}}}
default description for non-info{{{1
entries description is probbably about the foodinfo used. none info needs to say sth like "manual". maybe hide desc if null? it's takin vert space even when empty i think
 - Need to check both info and noninfo look okok
 - its too tall still..maybe not variable row height?
 - descriptino needs smaller italicetc
 > ok ive added some colors to check blocks. font changed.
 - hmm, changing double stack to a grid.
 - yep good. needs fill or center vertical aligns.
 - left and right ones arent filling or aligning.
 - one had out or range row..
}}}
need initial edit validation {{{
when editing, it doesnt initially validate, so you cant just click ok...
}}}
DateRequest needed now {{{
cause we upgraded datetimerequest to have time, but, not all ppl wat the time
 - tracker wants just date.
}}}
red when first time {{{
shouldnt inval red if just started on valuerequestview... neds that switch
 still crashes! omg. its def a bug in Frame into canvas.java.  I'm using sth different and lo it works.
}}}

}}}

same with choose on info as well as the vrv...
}}}
delete info, edit assoc entry, crash{{{
cause the query is empty. need to manage like when we delete a tracker instance somehow.  Perhaps reset to a quick entry with relevant values and make a note. or give options...
 - added defense, entryies get disconnected on contact.  needs a warning on delete tought
}}}

some entries might still refer toit, and will be reset next time
