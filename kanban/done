flectors are fucked?{{{
 - well, adding an entry with an info doesnt work, crashes during flector. I did change te impl of those.  I cant breakpoint it either...sth strange maybe VS+Xamarin? Dunno.  I'm tracing instead.
 - so GetDeclaredProperty we replaced for the PCL with, will not get properties of superclasses, only those declared on the class inspecting. abstracted into IPlatform and acutlay the plats are implimenting with GetProperty.
}}}
manage on in/out should be infos?{{{
manage is silly....bettwer describing word?
use off of dialect like "foods" "burns"?
}}}
100g Grams on info screen{{{
sth went wrong there....
it is totally fucked now. object.tostring
}}}
VRV Title Formatting{{{1
it's got issues, naming, caps etc
 - defaulter are stull fucked}}}
npe propchance "valid" on vrVM{{{
dunno what's triggering it...perhaps the converter?
only got it on second opening of "eat"

that makes sense.  I've moved to manual observation of inotifiyproperychanged cause i dont trust setbinding to remove the old binding. second time would indeed be the crash.
 - nope still fucks it.  it's on "resetrequests" so perhaps sth bound still to "valid" that's out of scope?
 - looks fixed.  I've done unbinding on ClearItmems on the vrv. proabbly reusing the valuerequestobjects.
}}}
crash on findy for food info?{{{1
was not impl exception so..who knows.  we dont have a real impl mayb just remove that test one?
still button there on foorm.....hgmmmm
ther's a finderadapter that inserts, it wasnt checking "canfind" property lol. should call it the "pleasedont" property :D
 - searchy is gone.
}}}
what happens when u remove last ti {{{
in maintabs.selectedplanitem, it does value.thing...
 - it;s well fucked. cant click any plan,well i added a new and selecging it did nothing. theres sth broken in there?
 - ive added logging around selecting instnaces see if it completes.
 - ok and i have crash on fresh app, adding instance,jnpe on inTabName. hmm. check ui marshaling?
 - alight the MTVM class doesnt contain SelectedPlanItem.  It's probabbly the root of all problems here. i've pushed it accrosss...
 - i think it was because we didnt wait for popasyncs to complete before altering the uis.  proper awaits now.
}}}
vrv date and time on entries{{{1 
yeah
ive slapped on a timepicker bound to same thing...see if that plays nice.
ok stacking it...would love flowlayout...
looks stupid, again flow would be nice. might just vstack it. 
 - ok well idk if works, the entrylinevm is just showing 00:04 all the times...
ok thats the month in MM....still weird. I think probabbly the request isnt doing anything.
ive set bp on after vrv to se whats happening on the value...it should work..
 - displays ok, but, vrv not binding to the time of "when"
 - cause really ned datepicker.format. see if this one works!!
 - nope. need timepicker, but it uses TimeSpan. need converter.
 - ok wrong converter assgiened?
 - and more fucked stuff. only had convert on one!
 - ok it works, but theres another bug im raising.  sqlite.net is decrementing values by 1h when storing! unless datetimeasticks is set to false :/.
}}}
Validition highghting is turned off {{{1
it got turned off fixing canvas bug, can put on row of the vrv
 - it's not redding
 - the frame has fucky padding

 - hmm ok well maybe this time? I'm manual bindings now ... but maybe frame.outlinecolor isnt right.  where is that thicknessss? maybe is not what i think it is.
 - lookslike it;s not defaulting to off. otherwise looks k. the ignore i mean.
 - it's off allrght, but not being turned on after clicky!
 - but it worked on tracker add...hmm..just on entries its not redding...
- gonna hae to debug this.
 - there was a mising ui invoke.
 - still nope. hmm.
 - crashy times too
 - is ok now. it seems
}}}
default description for non-info{{{1
entries description is probbably about the foodinfo used. none info needs to say sth like "manual". maybe hide desc if null? it's takin vert space even when empty i think
 - Need to check both info and noninfo look okok
 - its too tall still..maybe not variable row height?
 - descriptino needs smaller italicetc
 > ok ive added some colors to check blocks. font changed.
 - hmm, changing double stack to a grid.
 - yep good. needs fill or center vertical aligns.
 - left and right ones arent filling or aligning.
 - one had out or range row..
}}}
need initial edit validation {{{
when editing, it doesnt initially validate, so you cant just click ok...
}}}
DateRequest needed now {{{
cause we upgraded datetimerequest to have time, but, not all ppl wat the time
 - tracker wants just date.
}}}
red when first time {{{
shouldnt inval red if just started on valuerequestview... neds that switch
 still crashes! omg. its def a bug in Frame into canvas.java.  I'm using sth different and lo it works.
}}}
choose is showing on manage screen{{{
it should be off! hmmmmm
}}}
delete info the list doesnt update{{{
not sure, it's manually bound.
}}}
says 100g grams {{{
it should say xxx grams
}}}
caloreris per 1 day on plan {{{
thats dumb...improve texties!
}}}
when not tied to repeaters well{{{
repeat every gets now insead of the date on the repeater.  dunno about repeaton.
}}}
repeatevery need time too{{{
at least.
ok.  it just keeps when on the thing and updates using that.
}}}
choose info is async{{{
can openit twice...
same with choose on info as well as the vrv...
}}}
delete info, edit assoc entry, crash{{{
cause the query is empty. need to manage like when we delete a tracker instance somehow.  Perhaps reset to a quick entry with relevant values and make a note. or give options...
 - added defense, entryies get disconnected on contact.  needs a warning on delete tought
}}}
need warn delete info with fkr{{{
some entries might still refer toit, and will be reset next time
}}}
crash vrv r on {{{
if you select less than 2 options.
}}}
imporve repeaters vrvs {{{
can we set size of switch box? hmm
alignment?
has start -> has _finish_
they need datetime? oneliners too ^^
needs pen/paper design :/

needs tracksy view{{{
yeah it's totally not there...
}}}
ranges for weektrack are bad! {{{
it just like days from the current day. etc. or somthing. it also says 8 days, 0 days for ranges!
ok. note on the weektrack that you gotta start it on monday!
then, the thing is weektrack is becoming a target for the trackerinstanceVM (wrong) as well as the trackertracksVM (properly).
simpletracky helpy doesnt differentiate - ITrackerPresenter could, so helpy should I guess.
}}}
plan list missing aggregation{{{
it's got the pattern part, but not the range part.
i dont think it's supposed to show that. did stuff tho
}}}
mixup of pk between tables?{{{
or maybe the instance is stored on same table?  ot a scav cal diet and normal one, seems to be sharing entries!!!
yes, because the calorie diets share entry types.  neither tracker knows which are his. lets just not do it, only fix is a table-scope identifier right now.
}}}
loading state doesnt really work{{{
it should come on right after an action and before starting work. and go off after finishing work and updates to ui complete.
former just needs better thought - latter should be guarnteed by the event firing triggering ui updates IF the event handlers are synchronous
also, it would be "safer" as a modal dialog.
also, we should be disabling more than just the lists? hmm it's annoying, here's the options:
1) granular - more state managment needed than just disabling the relevant list and showing "loading". Add needs disabling too, for example.  Also, it doesnt seem to flow well, should be guranteed to show on each DAL change (too quick sometimes?)
2) global - just show informative spinner modal dialog when loading happens.  Easier to manage, possibly more annoying for user?
}}}
deleting plans locks ui{{{
should be farmed off
check others?
add/edit are intentionally not threaded (immediate action is to push view)
remove however does a lot of work, got lumped in with that logic.
}}}
deleting plan causes ripple?{{{
delete plan with entries causes ui refresh for each entry as they are deleted? maybe just 3 (1 per table) either way, should only be one refresh.  Perhaps should suspend/resume the DAL?
}}}
loading state doesnt show{{{
got dialog now...latched.  but, it doesnt usually appear. could insist it appears for atleast a few seconds by delaying the callback on shown
ok that sucked.  Ive mved to proper datasources, IVMlist, that have a busy bool too.  each changetype is mapped into an action that busies that source whil data for it is being got.  dal hands off changes via "willchange" event, taskmapper executes as a prior, before goting toget new data, and releaseing the busy.

view just needs to respect the busy flag now and show something sensible.

this was a big refactor.
}}}
ttview has 1 item after removing last plan{{{
not sure why. also doesnt hide when items.count==0...
}}}
hide ttv when no items{{{
cause yeah...
}}}
worried about my button size hacks {{{
involves a lot of absolute or relative size changes...not sure if it's cross-device compatible. or even on same os with different settings.
the textsizedbutton is good though. if i can find a way to remove the h and v hacks?
using textsizedbutton now, but, theres something on ttview that sucks still when its fillmode and expanding...
ok - textsizedbuton working. trick is to hook invalidatemeasure to sucessfully measure the label size. then to update the width/height of the grid cell - not heightrequest or any of those.
}}}
need multiple quantifiers {{{
cause, might be a serving, or grams or whatever!
or. or we can say "oh it's name depends on the info instance"
yeah - impl across helpy and HelpyBaseInfos via creators and IDs
}}}
burn tab infos goes to in tab infos? {{{
probabby just after moving to view the collections fully, not calling rigt one

manageinfo not responding to changes{{{
but i think it fires...
