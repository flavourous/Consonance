need to impiment invention{{{
not sure exactly how, but can start with sth basic that can be versioned off with newer better schema

ok - invention can be against each "trackyhelper". right now we have single quant, single track, single entryvar == tracked.  Can invent against that.

future expanded trackyhelpers with >1 quant,track,entryvar and other relations can define thier own invention.

so, invention can be done with a ValueRequestBuilder? the big challenge is that the trackyhelper needs type inputs.  Can we generate types at runtime reliably and reproducably?

mapping of the ORM to types is based largely on name, and will work if there are matching properties.  So it should work OK, if we can make types that is.

deleting plans locks ui{{{
should be farmed off

loading state doesnt really work{{{
it should come on right after an action and before starting work. and go off after finishing work and updates to ui complete.
former just needs better thought - latter should be guarnteed by the event firing triggering ui updates IF the event handlers are synchronous
also, it would be "safer" as a modal dialog.
