vrv date and time on entries{{{1 
yeah
ive slapped on a timepicker bound to same thing...see if that plays nice.
ok stacking it...would love flowlayout...
looks stupid, again flow would be nice. might just vstack it. 
 - ok well idk if works, the entrylinevm is just showing 00:04 all the times...
ok thats the month in MM....still weird. I think probabbly the request isnt doing anything.
ive set bp on after vrv to se whats happening on the value...it should work..
 - displays ok, but, vrv not binding to the time of "when"
}}}
Validition highghting is turned off {{{1
it got turned off fixing canvas bug, can put on row of the vrv
 - it's not redding
 - the frame has fucky padding

 - hmm ok well maybe this time? I'm manual bindings now ... but maybe frame.outlinecolor isnt right.  where is that thicknessss? maybe is not what i think it is.
 - lookslike it;s not defaulting to off. otherwise looks k. the ignore i mean.
