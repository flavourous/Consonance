need to impiment invention{{{
not sure exactly how, but can start with sth basic that can be versioned off with newer better schema

ok - invention can be against each "trackyhelper". right now we have single quant, single track, single entryvar == tracked.  Can invent against that.

future expanded trackyhelpers with >1 quant,track,entryvar and other relations can define thier own invention.

so, invention can be done with a ValueRequestBuilder? the big challenge is that the trackyhelper needs type inputs.  Can we generate types at runtime reliably and reproducably?

mapping of the ORM to types is based largely on name, and will work if there are matching properties.  So it should work OK, if we can make types that is.

 - just reorganising bits
 - need that quantifier choice! helpy is placing on info with creators and stuff.
 - ok done, is simpler now. need combo request request is all (and testing)
 - time to attempt!
