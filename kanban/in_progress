default description for non-info{{{1
entries description is probbably about the foodinfo used. none info needs to say sth like "manual". maybe hide desc if null? it's takin vert space even when empty i think
 - Need to check both info and noninfo look okok
 - its too tall still..maybe not variable row height?
 - descriptino needs smaller italicetc
